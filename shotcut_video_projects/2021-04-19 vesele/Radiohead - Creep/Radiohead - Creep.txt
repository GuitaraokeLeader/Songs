[Verse 1]
                     G                              H
When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eyes
                    C                         Cm
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
                 G                      H
You float like a feather in a beautiful world
             C                          Cm
I wish I was special, you're so fucking special
 
[Chorus] (play loud)
G (x3, very short)
          G            H
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         C               Cm
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here
 
[Verse 2]
                   G                      H
I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
                 C                      Cm
I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
              G                    H
I want you to notice when I'm not around
                  C                     Cm
You're so fucking special, I wish I was special
 
[Chorus] (play loud)
G (x3, very short)
          G            H
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         C               Cm
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here
 
[Bridge] (play loud)
            G                     H
Oooh, oooh, she's running out the door...
C                      Cm
She's running out, she run, run, run...
G     H
Ruuuuuuuun...
C     Cm
Ruuuuuuuuuuun...
 
[Verse 3] (play soft until the end)
                   G                   H
Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want
                  C                     Cm
You're so fucking special, I wish I was special
 
[Chorus]
          G            H
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         C               Cm
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here
          G
I don't belong here
